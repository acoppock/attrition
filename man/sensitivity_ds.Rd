\usage{
sensitivity_ds(Y, Z, R1, Attempt, R2, minY, maxY, sims = 100, strata = NULL,
  alpha = 0.05, data)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{The (unquoted) outcome variable. Must be numeric.}

\item{Z}{The (unquoted) assignment indicator variable. Must be numeric and take values 0 or 1.}

\item{R1}{The (unquoted) initial sample respose indicator variable. Must be numeric and take values 0 or 1.}

\item{Attempt}{The (unquoted) follow-up sample attempt indicator variable. Must be numeric and take values 0 or 1.}

\item{R2}{The (unquoted) follow-up sample respose indicator variable. Must be numeric and take values 0 or 1.}

\item{minY}{The minimum possible value of the outcome (Y) variable.}

\item{maxY}{The maximum possible value of the outcome (Y) variable.}

\item{sims}{Number of points at which to evaluate sensitivity test. Defaults to 100}

\item{strata}{A single (unquoted) variable that indicates which strata units are in.}

\item{alpha}{The desired significance level. 0.05 by default.}

\item{data}{A dataframe}
}
\value{
A list containing a ggplot object, a dataframe of simulated bounds and cis, and a value of pstar, if it exists.
